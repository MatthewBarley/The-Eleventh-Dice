The current directory is the "The Eleventh Dice" shared folder accessible only by
team members. The procedure to join the group has already been explained in the
Data Management Document.

This directory contains a local GIT repository, which will update together with the
shared folder, such that every member has always the repository updated.

The remote repository, which is linked to the local one, can be found at this URL:
